    <h2>Where It All Started ✨</h2>
    <p>
      One day, Puzhgal was late.<br>
      I came to the ground,
      and that’s when I saw you.<br><br>
      You started talking to me,
      and just like that,
      our very first conversation began —
      something simple that changed everything.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Match 🏏</h2>
    <p>
      Soon after,
      we were playing a match in coaching.<br><br>
      I got out,
      and you looked at me and said —
      <em>“Idiot!!”</em><br><br>
      I don’t know why,
      but that moment stayed with me.<br>
      And yes — in a very good way.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Small Moments 💬</h2>
    <p>
      And remember that ,
      I gave you a side hug — omggg i was
      jumping inside my head it was
      simple, quick, but unforgettable.<br><br>
      It wasn’t a big moment,
      but it meant more than it probably looked.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Lie I Told 🤍</h2>
    <p>
      I still remember telling you
      that I already had someone in my love life.<br><br>
      That wasn’t true.<br><br>
      I said it because I thought
      it would help me win your trust —
      and I know now that it was a really bad idea.<br><br>
      But even then,
      my feelings for you were already real.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Distance & Calls 📞</h2>
    <p>
      When I went to my native,
      we were still talking on call.<br><br>
      Distance never really mattered,
      because hearing your voice
      always made things feel close.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>13th July ❤️</h2>
    <p>
      The day I asked you —
      the proposal wasn’t perfect,
      maybe even a little messy.<br><br>
      But that one word you said…<br>
      <strong>“Yes.”</strong><br><br>
      It still echoes in my head,
      clear and unforgettable.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Book 📖</h2>
    <p>
      I wrote a book for you.<br>
      And a week later,
      it was officially published —
      with a real paperback in my hands.<br><br>
      A piece of our story,
      written forever.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Your Birthday 🎂</h2>
    <p>
      On your birthday,
      I gave you the necklace.<br><br>
      When I put it around your neck,
      my heart was racing —
      butterflies everywhere.<br><br>
      And then came our first hug,
      a moment I’ll never forget.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Little Tricks 🤍</h2>
    <p>
      I even made up a random game,
      just so I could hold your hands.<br><br>
      And honestly,
      I’d do it all over again.
